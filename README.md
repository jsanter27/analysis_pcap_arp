# CSE 310 Programming Assignment 3

#### ARP Packet analysis from .pcap files

This script iterates through packets captured in a .pcap file (from Wireshark) and outputs stats and information
relating to the ARP packets in the capture.

## How to Run the Script

This script must be ran through the commandline. It can be ran two ways: with or without an argument.

##### With File Path Argument

```
C:\DIRECTORY>python analysis_pcap_arp.py [file path]
```

##### Without Argument

```
C:\DIRECTORY>python analysis_pcap_arp.py

Enter the path of the .pcap file: [file path]
```

As you can see, you'll be prompted to enter the file path.
